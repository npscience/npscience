### Hi, welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently switching into data science after 10 years' experience in several types of research and analysis. I recently completed an intensive bootcamp in professional data analysis (CodeClan, Scotland).

My "why" is to use data to inform and improve solutions for real-world problems, especially in the domains of environmental sustainability, nutrition and health, and internet communication technologies. I love spotting patterns, helping people to connect and share knowledge, and designing functional *and* visually appealing products.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on translating my [final CodeClan project](https://github.com/npscience/final_project_london_energy_weather_forecasting) from R into Python
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make environment-friendly data and coding infrastructure choices (see [GoCodeGreen](https://learning.gocode.green/)!)
- ðŸ“š My previous experience is in neuroscience research, business research/design projects in science publishing/funding & technology, open science/open source community management, events design/facilitation (hackathons, workshops) and communications

P.S. you can set up a README for your profile too, see [the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
